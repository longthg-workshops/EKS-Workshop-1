### Attention !

Cloud 9 has been deprecated and may not be supported for new accounts. We recommend moving to our suggested alternative solutions in _2-Prerequiste_.

Official statement from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/how-to-migrate-from-aws-cloud9-to-aws-ide-toolkits-or-aws-cloudshell/):

_After careful consideration, we have made the decision to close new customer access to AWS Cloud9, effective July 25, 2024. AWS Cloud9 existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. AWS continues to invest in security, availability, and performance improvements for AWS Cloud9, but we do not plan to introduce new features._
